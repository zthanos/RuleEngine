Yes, it is valid to design a rule engine to work with JSON objects or dictionaries as the applied-to types. This approach is often referred to as working with "weakly typed" or "dynamic" data. Here are some considerations:

1.  Flexibility:

    -   Using JSON or dictionaries provides flexibility because the structure of the data can be dynamic and doesn't need to be known at compile time.
2.  Dynamic Schema:

    -   JSON and dictionaries allow you to represent data with a dynamic schema. This can be useful when dealing with data that doesn't conform to a rigid, predefined structure.
3.  Adaptability:

    -   Rules can adapt to different types of data without requiring changes to the rule engine or rule definitions. This can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the data schema evolves over time.
4.  Generic Rule Engine:

    -   A rule engine designed to work with weakly typed data can be more generic and handle a wider range of scenarios. This is especially useful in applications dealing with data integration or data transformations.
5.  Serialization and Deserialization:

    -   Ensure that you have robust mechanisms for serializing and deserializing JSON or dictionary data. This is crucial for interacting with external systems, storing rules, or persisting rule execution results.
6.  Performance Considerations:

    -   Working with weakly typed data may introduce some performance overhead due to runtime type checks and conversions. Evaluate the performance impact based on your specific use case.

However, keep in mind that there are trade-offs. Strongly typed systems provide compile-time safety, better tooling support, and improved code readability. The decision to use weakly typed data should align with the requirements and constraints of your specific application.

Additionally, ensure that the rule engine's design and rule definitions can handle the dynamic nature of the data effectively, and provide clear documentation on how rules should be constructed when working with JSON or dictionaries.
