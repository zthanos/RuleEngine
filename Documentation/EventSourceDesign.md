### Defining Events

Your initial event definitions are on the right track. Here's a bit more detail to consider for each event:

1.  CreateRuleForType: Triggered when a new rule type is created.

    -   Properties: `ClientId`, `RuleTypeId`, `Timestamp`, `InitialRules`, 'Schema', 'Version'.
2.  AddRuleToType: Occurs when a new rule is added to an existing type.

    -   Properties: `ClientId`, `RuleTypeId`, `RuleId`, `RuleContent`, `Timestamp`.
3.  DeactivateRuleInType: Fired when a rule within a type is deactivated.

    -   Properties: `ClientId`, `RuleTypeId`, `RuleId`, `Timestamp`.
4.  ExecuteRuleForType: Emitted when a rule is executed.

    -   Properties: `ClientId`, `RuleTypeId`, `RuleId`, `InputData`, `OutputData`, `Timestamp`, `ExecutionResult`.

### Projections

Projections are used to process events in the stream and create read models, other event streams, or trigger side effects. For your rule engine, consider projections that:

1.  Current Rule State: A projection that maintains the current set of active rules for each type, useful for quick lookups before rule execution.

2.  Rule Execution History: Keeps a history of rule executions, including inputs, outputs, and results, allowing for detailed analysis and debugging.

3.  Rule Changes Over Time: Tracks how rules for each type evolve, capturing additions, updates, and deactivations.


### Implementation Considerations

-   Event Versioning: Design your events with future changes in mind. Include a version number in each event to accommodate changes in the event schema over time.

-   Idempotency: Ensure that your event handlers are idempotent; processing the same event multiple times should not change the outcome.

-   Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging within your event handlers and projections to deal with processing failures.
