### Interface Specification Document

#### 1\. Introduction

This document specifies the interfaces used in the forward chaining rule engine. It describes the methods, properties, and interactions of these interfaces, facilitating understanding of the system's modular design and integration points.

#### 2\. Interface Descriptions

##### IRule Interface (`IRule.cs`)

-   Purpose: Defines the contract for all rule types in the system.
-   Methods:
    -   `Evaluate`: Determines whether the rule's conditions are met.
    -   `ExecuteAction`: Executes the action associated with the rule if the conditions are satisfied.
-   Properties: (List any properties if present)
-   Used By: Implemented by the `Rule` class.
-   Interacts With: Utilized by the `RuleEngine` for evaluating rules.

##### Other Interfaces

-   (List other interfaces similarly, detailing their purpose, methods, properties, users, and interactions.)

#### 3\. Method Specifications

##### IRule.Evaluate

-   Description: Evaluates the rule's conditions against the given context.
-   Input Parameters:
    -   `context`: The data or environment in which the rule is evaluated.
-   Return Type: `bool` (true if conditions are met, false otherwise).
-   Exceptions: (List any exceptions that might be thrown)

##### IRule.ExecuteAction

-   Description: Executes the action associated with the rule.
-   Input Parameters: None or context (as required).
-   Return Type: Void or appropriate type.
-   Exceptions: (List any exceptions that might be thrown)

##### (Detail other methods similarly.)

#### 4\. Interaction Diagrams

-   (Include any UML diagrams or flowcharts that illustrate how these interfaces interact within the system. This might involve showing how `RuleEngine` invokes `IRule` methods, etc.)

#### 5\. Change History

-   (Document the versioning and changes made to the interfaces over time. This section is essential for maintaining the document and understanding the evolution of the interface designs.)

#### 6\. Conclusion

This document provides a comprehensive specification of the interfaces used in the rule engine system. It is intended for developers and architects who are involved in developing, maintaining, or integrating with this system. The document should be updated as the system evolves to reflect any changes to the interfaces.
