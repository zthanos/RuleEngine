The typical flow for rule execution involves:

1.  Parsing and Validating Input Data: In your case, this step involves parsing the JSON data and validating it against the specified JSON schema. This is crucial to ensure that the input data conforms to the expected structure.

2.  Applying Conditions: Once the data is validated, you can proceed with applying rule conditions. Conditions typically involve evaluating logical expressions or predicates against the validated data.

3.  Taking Actions: If the conditions are met, the associated actions specified in the rules are executed. This step involves making changes to the target objects or performing other operations based on the rule logic.
