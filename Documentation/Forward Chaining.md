# Forward Chaining:

Forward chaining is a reasoning strategy that starts with the available data and applies rules to derive new conclusions. It's often referred to as "data-driven" reasoning. In the context of a rule engine, it means starting with the initial facts and applying rules iteratively until no more rules can be triggered.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initialize Working Memory:**

    - Identify and gather the initial facts or data (working memory).
    - In your case, the working memory would be the state of your objects that will be evaluated against the rules.
1. **Execute Rules:**
    - Apply rules to the working memory.
    - For each rule, evaluate its conditions against the working memory.
    - If a rule's conditions are satisfied, execute its actions.
    - This might involve updating the working memory with new facts.

1.  **Iterate:**

    - Repeat the process until no more rules can be triggered.
    - This is the iterative part where new facts derived from one rule might trigger another rule.

1. **Termination:**

    - Define conditions for termination. This could be a specific rule being triggered, a certain state achieved, or a predefined number of iterations.

### Implementation in Rule Engine:

In your rule engine, you can follow these steps:

- **Working Memory:**

    - The state of your objects represents the working memory.
    - The objects that will be evaluated against the rules.

- **Execute Rules:**

    - Use your Rules class to iterate through the rules and apply them to the working memory.
    - Each rule, when applied, might update the working memory.

- **Iterate:**

    - Repeat the process until no more rules can be triggered or until a termination condition is met.
- **Termination:**

    -   Define conditions for terminating the forward chaining process.
### Example:

Consider a set of rules related to discounts in an e-commerce system:

1. Rule: If total purchase amount > $100, apply a 10% discount.
1. Rule: If user is a premium member, apply an additional 5% discount.

If a user's total purchase amount is $120 and they are a premium member, forward chaining would:

- Start with the fact: Total purchase amount is $120.
- Rule 1 is triggered and applies a 10% discount.
- Rule 2 is triggered (because the user is a premium member) and applies an additional 5% discount.

So, the final conclusion is a 15% discount.

This is a simplified example, and your rules might involve more complex conditions and actions.
