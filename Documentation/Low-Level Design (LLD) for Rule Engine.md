### Low-Level Design (LLD) for Rule Engine

#### 1\. Introduction

This LLD provides a detailed view of the components within the rule engine system, focusing on classes, methods, data structures, and their interactions.

#### 2\. Class Design

##### a. Rule (`Rule.cs`)

-   Responsibility: Represents an individual rule.
-   Methods: Likely includes methods for setting conditions, defining actions, and evaluating the rule.
-   Properties: May include properties related to rule metadata such as ID, name, description.

##### b. RuleCondition (`RuleCondition.cs`)

-   Responsibility: Defines conditions for a rule.
-   Methods: Typically involves methods for evaluating the condition against provided data.
-   Properties: May have properties for condition parameters and types.

##### c. RuleAction (`RuleAction.cs`)

-   Responsibility: Encapsulates the action to be taken when a rule's condition is met.
-   Methods: Likely contains a method to execute the action.
-   Properties: May include properties defining the action details.

##### d. ConditionBuilder (`ConditionBuilder.cs`)

-   Responsibility: Provides a fluent interface for constructing rule conditions.
-   Methods: Methods for adding conditions, logical operators, etc.
-   Properties: Internal state for building up a condition.

##### e. RuleBuilder (`RuleBuilder.cs`)

-   Responsibility: Facilitates the construction of rules.
-   Methods: Methods for adding conditions, actions, and constructing the final `Rule` object.
-   Properties: Internal state for assembling a rule.

##### f. Rules Collection (`Rules.cs`)

-   Responsibility: Manages a collection of rules.
-   Methods: Methods for adding, removing, and evaluating rules.
-   Properties: A list or set of `Rule` objects.

#### 3\. Data Structures and Models

-   Rule: Structure for representing rules, including conditions and actions.
-   RuleCondition: Format for defining a condition, including type and parameters.
-   RuleAction: Structure for actions, potentially including action type and parameters.

#### 4\. Interaction and Flow

-   Rule Evaluation Process: Detailed flow of how a rule is evaluated, from condition checking to action execution.
-   Interaction with Rule Engine: How the `Rule` class interacts with the rule engine for evaluation.

#### 5\. Error Handling and Logging

-   Strategy for Error Handling: Mechanisms for handling exceptions or invalid rule definitions.
-   Logging Mechanisms: Approaches for logging rule evaluations, conditions met, and actions taken.

#### 6\. Unit Testing and Validation

-   Unit Tests (`CustomerUnitTests.cs`): Strategies and methods for testing each component of the rule engine, ensuring reliability and correctness.

#### 7\. Conclusion and Recommendations

-   Performance Considerations: Strategies for optimizing rule evaluation, especially important in systems with a large number of complex rules.
-   Scalability and Extensibility: Recommendations for ensuring the system can scale and be extended with new types of rules, conditions, and actions.
