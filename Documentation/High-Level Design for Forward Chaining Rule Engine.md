### High-Level Design for Forward Chaining Rule Engine

#### 1\. Components Overview

-   Rule Engine

    -   Core component orchestrating the rule evaluation process using forward chaining.
    -   Manages the flow of data and triggers rules based on conditions.
-   IRule Interface

    -   Defines the structure and behavior expected from each rule.
    -   Implemented by the `Rule` class.
-   Rule (implements IRule)

    -   Encapsulates individual rule logic.
    -   Contains conditions and actions.
-   RuleCondition

    -   Defines the specific conditions under which a rule is triggered.
    -   Used by `Rule` to evaluate if the rule should be executed.
-   RuleAction

    -   Represents actions to be executed when a rule's conditions are met.
    -   Linked to a `Rule` and triggered upon successful condition evaluation.
-   ConditionBuilder

    -   Provides a fluent interface to define conditions.
    -   Used to create `RuleCondition` instances in a readable and maintainable way.
-   RuleBuilder

    -   Allows for fluent construction of `Rule` objects.
    -   Facilitates defining rules with conditions and actions in a cohesive manner.
-   Rules Collection

    -   A collection or repository of `Rule` objects.
    -   The Rule Engine queries this collection to retrieve and evaluate rules.

#### 2\. Data Flow

1.  Initialization: The Rule Engine initializes, loading rules from the Rules Collection.

2.  Rule Definition: Rules are defined using `RuleBuilder`, which internally utilizes `ConditionBuilder` to construct conditions.

3.  Rule Evaluation (Forward Chaining):

    -   The Rule Engine iteratively evaluates rules from the Rules Collection.
    -   For each rule, `RuleCondition` is evaluated. If true, the corresponding `RuleAction` is executed.
    -   This process continues, with the outcome of one rule potentially influencing the conditions of subsequent rules, consistent with forward chaining logic.
4.  Action Execution:

    -   Once a rule's condition is met, the associated `RuleAction` is executed.
    -   Actions may include data manipulation, triggering events, or further rule evaluations.
5.  Feedback Loop:

    -   The results of actions may influence the data set or context, affecting the evaluation of subsequent rules.
    -   This loop continues until no more rules are triggered or a specific termination condition is met.

#### 3\. Additional Considerations

-   Performance Optimization: Given the iterative nature of forward chaining, the system should be optimized for performance, especially in handling complex rules and large datasets.
-   Scalability: The design should accommodate scaling, both in terms of the number of rules and the complexity of conditions and actions.
-   Extensibility: The modular nature of the system should allow for easy addition of new types of rules, conditions, and actions.
